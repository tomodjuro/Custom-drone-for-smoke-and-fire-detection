# Custom-drone-for-smoke-and-fire-detection
Custom drone that can fly automatically and detect smoke and fire by processing stream from Raspberry Pi camera, using artificial intelligence and computer vision

We assembled the drone from scratch, first by printing the body and arms of the drone on a 3D printer and then connecting the ESC, FC, GPS, motors, antenna for the controller and the Raspberry Pi. This was followed by configuration and calibration in Mission Planer and Esc Configurator and finally flight testing. My team’s final project was to make custom drone that can fly automatically and detect smoke and fire by processing stream from Raspberry Pi camera, using artificial intelligence and computer vision.
